# PortFolio
This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my journey as a programmer. Built with HTML and styled with CSS, the site features a background image, custom fonts, and sections detailing my skills and interests. The website includes interactive elements such as a profile photo and a contact button for connecting with me.
